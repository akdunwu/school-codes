# school-codes
Codes I have written in past several years.

*Matlab
Project of image processing 2 years ago, which I later developed into a GUI project.
MVO Monte Carlo Simulation. I didn't know about algorithms back then, and the efficiency of that code was awful.

*SAS
A lot of school projects including time series modeling, multivariate regression, etc.

*Python
Algorithms.
