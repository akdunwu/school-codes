Logics of Q2 & Q3:

Q2.Look at ACF set of unemp(1) (1st-order difference) first, that is, the 1st ACF set.
	-I have increased the lag into 48 for it to be more obvious.
	-ACF on seasonal terms (that is, lag 12, 24, 36, 48) decays very slowly.
	-Therefore the 1st-order differenced series (the 'nonseasonal difference of the
	 series') is not stationary.
   Then, look at ACF set of unemp(1,12) (the required difference series in the question),
   that is, the 2nd ACF set.
	-Now, seasonal ACF converges to zero quickly.
	-You can also talk about interaction terms being significant but that is totally
	 optional.

Q3.Look at ACF set of unemp(1,12).
	-ACF decays quickly for both nonseasonal lags (lags excluding 12, 24, 36, and 48)
	 and seasonal lags (12, 24, 36, and 48).
	-Some interaction terms are slightly significant but not a major concern, because
	they can be eliminated by multiplicative SARIMA model.
	-Therefore, the series looks stationary.
