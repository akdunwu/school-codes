Part 1.

In orders of frames:

1. Q1. TS plot.
2. ARIMA reduced to lag=6.
	Q1. Sample correlation.
	-The more comprehensive version is in Frame 3.
	-This plot shows autocorrelations greater than 3 are insignificant.
3. ARIMA with 2nd-order autoregression.
	-Q2.1.   ACF and PACF.
	-Q2.2.   Use ACF and PACF to determine order of the autoregression process.
	-Q2.3.1. 2nd-order autoregression model. (AR(2) is statistically insignificant.
4. ARIMA with 1st-order autoregression.
	-Q2.3.2. 1st-order autoregression model.
	-Q3.1.   Autocorrelation Check for White Noise.

Part 2.

Part 2 is basically a hand calculation problem.
I'd estimate 2-3 sentences/equations for each problem.
